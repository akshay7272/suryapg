    <h3>Before you move in</h3>
    <p class="mainP">Lists, lists, lists!</p>
    <p>There are a million-and-one things to think about when you're moving house, let alone if you're moving away from home 
    for the first time.</p>
    <p>Try and keep things simple and avoid bringing too much stuff with you.</p>
    <p>Take a look at our list of essentials:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Aadhar Card as proof of ID.</li>
    	<li>Bedding including duvet and cover, pillows and covers, sheets</li>
    	<li>Towels</li>
    	<li>Clothes hangers</li>
    	<li>Cleaning, washing up and laundry items</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mainP">When can I arrive?</p>
    <p>We can't wait for you to join us!</p>
    <p>Check-in opens from the start date on your contract or if you're an eager beaver and want to settle in sooner, get in touch 
    with us and where possible, we'll arrange for you to arrive early.</p>
    <p>We'll be in touch with you a few weeks before your start date with lots of handy tips and info, like what time the site is 
    open or what to do if you're arriving out of hours.</p>
    <p class="mainP">What can I expect on the day?</p>
    <p>Move-in day will be busy but really exciting!</p>
    <p>Our teams work really hard over the summer to make sure your check-in is as smooth and quick as possible. It really helps us 
    if you come prepared with your documents complete and your passport photos already printed.</p>
    <p>Your parents are welcome on move-in day, but we think it's always best to wave them good-bye as soon as possible so you can 
    settle in quickly and get to know new people, especially your roommate!</p>
